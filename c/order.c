// Food order.
//
// You and three friends go to a baseball game and you offer to go to the concession stand for everyone.
// They each order one thing, and you do as well. 
//
// Nachos and Pizza both cost $6.00. A Cheeseburger meal costs $10. Water is $4.00 and Coke is $5.00. Tax is 7%.
//
// Task 
// Determine the total cost of ordering four items from the concession stand. If one of your friendâ€™s orders something that isn't on the menu, you will order a Coke for them instead.
//
// Input Format
// You are given a string of the four items that you've been asked to order that are separated by spaces.
//
// Output Format 
// You will output a number of the total cost of the food and drinks.
//
// Sample Input 
// 'Pizza Cheeseburger Water Popcorn'
// 
// Sample Output 
// 26.75
//
// Explanation
// Because Popcorn is not on the menu, this friend gets a coke which brings the subtotal to $25.00 and $26.75 with tax.
